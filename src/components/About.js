                <p>I am currently a Project Manager at Siemens. I am passionate about learning how things work and enjoy the 
                process of coding new technologies that I can apply to my personal projects. Outside of work and coding,
                I enjoy lifting, golfing, skiing, going to the beach, and watching the Chicago Bears!</p>
